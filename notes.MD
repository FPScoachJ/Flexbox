# Flexbox

Default display - columns, does not wrap.

Flexbox (and grid) are used for responsive design

# To add flexbox, use `display: flex`

# justify-content - Affects horizontal axis - does not create new rows
    `center` - centers the items horizontally
    `end` - end of the container
    `start` - start of the container
    `space-around` - equal space between each item in the flexbox container (but not beginning)
    `space-evenly` - space evenly across the main axis
    `space-between` - evenly distributed across the main axis


* Key Point *

There is a parent/child relationship between the element you are targeting and the elements inside of it.

# flex-wrap

    `wrap` - wraps elements onto new rows below when space runs out
    `wrap-reverse` - same as wrap but raps elements to top row (*uncommon*)

# Align Items - Affects vertical axis
    `center` - centers the item vertically
